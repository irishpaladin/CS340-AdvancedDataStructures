It will loop until it is given a valid input. 
Once the input passes the validation, this program assumes:

	- Every operand has it's corresponding operator, vice versa
	- Every open parenthesis has it's corresponding closing parenthesis
	- Operands are int datatype
	- Negative operands has its digit and negative symbol together without spaces between
	- Input expression can be evaluated
